**July 31st**
> We've been working on the basics of GitHub, HTML, CSS and Javascript for the first 3 weeks. I have uploaded assignments that display an understanding of positioning HTML elements, styling them with CSS and animating them with JavaScript.  

**August 17th**
> Expanding on our understanding of JavaScript, we've begun to manipulate large sets of data. Writing logic that will perform tasks like compiling the data into arrays and/or objects, sorting, filtering and organizing that data acoording to specified criteria and then displaying it in a simple html expression. Working to add these projects to my portfolio.

**September 17th**
> The last few weeks have been really awesome. I feel like I have a mastery of the DOM and how to manipulate or create HTML and CSS elements with JavaScript. We've been learning to use events like button clicks, or cursor movement to create dynamic content. 
>We've been tasked with an official portfolio project which I am uploading today. I created an entirely new design using Bootstrap, which is a really robust system I very much enjoyed. I used their flexbox grid system and full window height elements for each section. Very happy with the work I've done!
