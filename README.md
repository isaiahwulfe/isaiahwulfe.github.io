**July 31st**
> We've been working on the basics of GitHub, HTML, CSS and Javascript for the first 3 weeks. I have uploaded assignments that display an understanding of positioning HTML elements, styling them with CSS and animating them with JavaScript.  

**August 17th**
> Expanding on our understanding of JavaScript, we've begun to manipulate large sets of data. Writing logic that will perform tasks like compiling the data into arrays and/or objects, sorting, filtering and organizing that data acoording to specified criteria and then displaying it in a simple html expression. Working to add these projects to my portfolio.
